# Sumobot

Sumobot is an open source sumobot design made for [BlueFletch Halloween Hack](http://bluefletch.com). Most existing sumo kits cost between $99 and $160. Since we're trying to keep our event costs down, I decided to try to design a bot that could be put together for around $50 including the cost of the Arduino.

## Provided Components

Each bot also requires 4 AA batteries, and you will need at least 2 long [usb cables](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BCWALHM/ref=twister_B00CES8HYM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) for battles.

## Rules of Engagement

+ You cannot include additional motors, servos, sensors, or shields, and must use what is provided.
+ You can 3D print parts to creatively apply the servo in battle.
+ You are free to extend the software to help your driver.
+ Robot must be able to fit in box of 11 cm width and 18 cm depth.  Height is not restricted.
+ Robot weight cannot exceed 1000 g.
+ The robot must not include a firing device (including blow torches).
+ The robot must not include a throwing device.
+ The robot must not include any part that fixes the robot and prevents it from moving (such as suckers, glue and so on).
+ The robot will not include any device that increases the apparent weight of the robot (such as vacuums, fans, or magnetic systems to push or pull the robot down onto the dohyo surface).

## Build instructions

+ Use the [Zumo Chassis instructions](https://github.com/mronemous/sumobot/blob/master/instructions/zumo-chassis.pdf) to build the base chassis.
+ Use the [build instructions](https://github.com/mronemous/sumobot/blob/master/instructions/build-instructions.pdf) to complete the sumobot.
